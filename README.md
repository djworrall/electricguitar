# Guitar Notes

Direct (DI) recordings of every note on a 24 fret electric guitar in standard tuning. This doesn't include every fret on every string, just every pitch available on the instrument. 

I believe after the 4th fret on the 2nd string I used the 1st string for the remaining notes.

## File names
Files are suffixed with the MIDI note they correspond to, e.g. `guitar40.aif` is the open 6th string (E), which is MIDI note 40.
